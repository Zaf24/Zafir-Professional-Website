# 🎬 My Professional Catalogue - Netflix-Inspired Portfolio

A cinematic, interactive personal website that showcases my multifaceted journey through a Netflix-style interface. Instead of movies and series, this portfolio presents my life experiences, achievements, and professional milestones as binge-worthy content.

## 🌟 Concept & Vision

Imagine Netflix, but instead of movies, it showcases me — my story, experiences, and achievements across different "series" in my life. Each series represents a major theme, and each episode goes deep into one story, event, or project. The goal is to make it feel fun, narrative-driven, and professional — like binge-watching my life and career.

## 📺 Series Overview

- **Speaking**: Talks, podcasts, hosting events, and Tamil storytelling that inspire and engage
- **Sports**: National-level basketball journey, teamwork lessons, and the discipline of athletics  
- **Essays**: Philosophical reflections on Tamil culture, technology, and thought leadership
- **Career**: Microsoft, tutoring, projects, certifications, and entrepreneurship—all in one place
